# Messaging Transport Architecture — Layer Guide

This is a companion to [`messaging_transports.md`](messaging_transports.md). The
plan doc is terse and assumes you already understand the architecture. This
guide explains the layer structure from the ground up so a newcomer can read
the plan and contribute to it.

---

## Why have layers at all?

Naively, if you only wanted Telegram support, you might write:

```ts
// naive implementation — do NOT do this
while (true) {
  const messages = await telegramApi.getMessages();
  for (const msg of messages) {
    const reply = await runAgent(msg.text); // ← directly invokes the agent
    await telegramApi.sendMessage(msg.chatId, reply);
  }
}
```

This works for Telegram alone. The problems show up when you want to add
more platforms:

1. Slack support → nearly-identical loop copied into `slack.ts`
2. LINE support → another copy
3. Every time the agent-invocation contract changes (new lifecycle hook,
   new logging requirement), **all five copies need to be updated in lockstep**
4. PR #106 hit exactly this — calling `runAgent()` directly bypassed
   session persistence, journal triggers, chat-index, and wiki-backlinks,
   so the Telegram bot was technically working but producing "ghost
   sessions" invisible to the rest of the system.

The messaging transport design introduces a cushion between "talking to an
external messaging platform" and "invoking the agent" so these concerns
live in exactly one place.

Layers 4 and 5 exist today. Layers 2 and 3 are what `messaging_transports.md`
proposes to build.

---

## What each layer does

### Layer 1 — External platforms

These are services we **don't control**. Each has its own:

- Authentication model (bot tokens, OAuth, signing secrets)
- Ingress pattern (polling vs webhooks)
- Message format (text limits, markup flavor, media handling)
- Rate limits and SLA constraints (Telegram's long-polling timeout,
  Slack's 3-second ACK, LINE's 1-minute reply-token, WhatsApp's 24-hour
  messaging window, Twitter/X's strict per-app and per-user rate limits)

Our code **conforms** to each of these — we can't change them. Everything
above this layer is under our control.

### Layer 2 — Transport adapters

Per-platform code. Each directory (`telegram/`, `slack/`, …) contains
everything specific to one platform:

```
server/transports/telegram/
  index.ts   ← MessagingTransport implementation + init()
  poll.ts    ← "Ask Telegram for new messages every 5s" loop, registered
                as a task with the task manager
  api.ts     ← Telegram API wrappers (sendMessage, getUpdates, sendTyping)
  types.ts   ← Telegram-specific response types
```

**Layer 2's two responsibilities, and nothing else:**

1. **Inbound**: parse a platform-specific message → build a normalized
   request → hand it to Layer 3
2. **Outbound**: receive a reply from Layer 3 → format for the platform →
   call the platform's API

**What Layer 2 does NOT know about:**

- `runAgent()` or `startChat()`
- Session IDs, role management, command parsing
- Pub/sub channels
- The workspace filesystem

If a platform's API changes (Telegram adds a new field, LINE deprecates
an endpoint), **only that platform's Layer 2 directory changes**. Every
other layer stays untouched.

### Layer 3 — Shared relay / chat-state / commands

This is where the five-way duplication from the naive design collapses
into one copy. Three sub-concerns:

#### 3a. `chat-state.ts` — who is this conversation?

Every external chat gets mapped to a MulmoClaude session, persisted as a
JSON file per chat:

```json
// ~/mulmoclaude/transports/telegram/chats/123.json
{
  "externalChatId": "123",
  "sessionId": "abc-def",
  "roleId": "general",
  "claudeSessionId": "xyz-789",
  "startedAt": "2026-04-14T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-04-14T12:30:00Z"
}
```

The state store hides the filesystem details behind a small API:

- `get(externalChatId)` — load or return null
- `set(state)` — persist (atomic write)
- `reset(externalChatId, roleId?)` — create a fresh session (new ID),
  make it active. The old session is **not deleted** — it stays in the
  sidebar for reference
- `connect(externalChatId, chatSessionId)` — point this chat at an
  existing MulmoClaude session. This is how `/connect` from the Web UI
  works (see "Session model" below)
- `delete(externalChatId)` — remove the mapping

**Session ID format**: `{transportId}-{externalChatId}-{timestamp}`
(e.g. `telegram-123-1713100000`). This makes the origin visible in the
Web UI sidebar at a glance.

Path safety is enforced via `resolveWithinRoot()` (shared with the file
explorer) so a malicious external ID can't escape the transport directory.

#### 3b. `commands.ts` — slash commands

A user typing `/role artist` or `/reset` should behave the same on
Telegram, LINE, Slack, WhatsApp. One implementation, called by all
Layer 2 adapters:

```ts
const result = await handleCommand(text, chatState);
if (result) {
  // command recognized — send result.reply back via Layer 2
  if (result.nextState) await chatStateStore.set(result.nextState);
  return result.reply;
}
// not a command — fall through to relay
```

If a platform needs a unique command (`/slack-thread`, say), it can wrap
or extend this handler without forking it.

#### 3c. Session model — one pointer per chat

MulmoClaude's Web UI supports multiple sessions (visible in the sidebar),
but a messaging app is a single continuous thread. How do we bridge
these two worlds?

The answer: **each messaging chat has exactly one "active session
pointer"**. This pointer is just the `sessionId` field in the chat-state
JSON file. Both the messaging app and the Web UI can change what it
points to:

```
Telegram chat 123
  ┌──────────────────────────────┐
  │ active session pointer:      │
  │   sessionId = "telegram-123-1713100000"  ──────► jsonl, sidebar, etc.
  │                              │
  │ Previous sessions:           │
  │   (still in sidebar,         │
  │    just not "active" here)   │
  └──────────────────────────────┘
```

**From the messaging app:**

- First message ever → creates `telegram-{chatId}-{timestamp}`, sets
  the pointer
- Subsequent messages → continue the same session via the pointer
- `/reset` → creates a **new** session, moves the pointer. The old
  session stays in the sidebar — it's not deleted
- `/role artist` → creates a new session with a different role, moves
  the pointer

**From the Web UI:**

- Any messaging session appears in the sidebar like a normal session.
  The user can open it and continue the conversation from the browser
- `/connect telegram` (or a "Connect to Telegram" button) → takes the
  currently-open browser session and makes it the active session for
  the Telegram chat. This calls `POST /api/transports/telegram/connect`
  which updates the pointer in the chat-state file

**Why this matters:** without this model, you get "ghost sessions" that
the Web UI can't see, or messaging chats that can't continue browser
conversations. The pointer model means sessions are just normal
MulmoClaude sessions — the pointer is a lightweight indirection that
both sides can manipulate.

#### 3d. `relay.ts` — the bridge to the agent

The single function that non-command text flows through:

```ts
export async function relayMessage({
  message,
  chatState,
  onText,
  onDone,
  onError,
}: RelayMessageParams): Promise<RelayResult> {
  // 1. Invoke Layer 4's public entry point
  //    Note: claudeSessionId is NOT a parameter — startChat() reads it
  //    from the session's meta file on disk automatically.
  const result = await startChat({
    chatSessionId: chatState.sessionId,
    message,
    roleId: chatState.roleId,
  });

  // 2. Subscribe to session events via pub/sub
  const unsubscribe = subscribeToSession(sessionId, (event) => {
    if (event.type === "text") onText?.(event.chunk);
    if (event.type === "done") finalize();
    if (event.type === "error") onError?.(event.message);
  });

  // 3. Await completion, collecting text into a full reply
  const fullReply = await collectUntilDone();
  unsubscribe();

  // 4. Persist the updated claudeSessionId back to chat-state
  await chatStateStore.set({
    ...chatState,
    claudeSessionId: /* from the agent's last event */,
    updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  });

  return { kind: "success", reply: fullReply };
}
```

**This is the function that PR #106 should have had but didn't.** The
naive `runAgent()` call becomes a `startChat()` call, and pub/sub event
collection takes the place of iterating agent events manually. Every
benefit of `startChat()` (jsonl, session-store, journal triggers,
chat-index) flows through automatically.

### Layer 4 — MulmoClaude core (existing)

We don't touch this layer in the messaging work — we just use it.

`startChat()` is the public entry point:

```
startChat()
  ├─ Validate session / create if new
  ├─ Append user message to jsonl
  ├─ Register in session-store (so the sidebar can see it)
  ├─ Mark session as running
  ├─ Launch runAgentInBackground()
  │    └─ runAgent()
  │         ├─ spawn claude CLI subprocess
  │         ├─ emit text events to pub/sub as tokens stream in
  │         ├─ emit tool_result events when plugins execute
  │         └─ emit done event on completion
  └─ After completion:
      ├─ Trigger journal daily-pass update
      ├─ Trigger chat-index summary
      └─ Trigger wiki-backlinks sweep
```

The Web UI uses this same entry point — the only difference is how the
caller subscribes to the resulting events (WebSocket in the browser,
in-process subscriber for Layer 3 relay). **Same agent, same session, same
lifecycle hooks.**

This is why adding Telegram doesn't require modifying the agent code: the
agent is downstream of `startChat()`, and `startChat()` doesn't care who
the caller is.

### Layer 5 — Claude CLI + workspace

The actual intelligence and the actual storage. `runAgent()` spawns
`claude` as a subprocess with MCP plugins configured. The workspace
(`~/mulmoclaude/`) is the database — wiki pages, todos, calendar, chat
jsonl, etc. all live as files.

Messaging transports don't interact with this layer directly. They don't
need to — Layer 4's `startChat()` covers everything they need to do.

## End-to-end example: "What's the weather today?" via Telegram

Sending a text message from your phone triggers this sequence:

```
[Phone — Telegram app]
  │  User types "What's the weather today?"
  ▼
[Telegram's server]
  │  Queues the message for the bot account
  ▼
[Layer 2: telegram/poll.ts]
  │  Polling task fires every 5s, calls getUpdates
  │  Gets {chatId: 123, text: "What's the weather today?"}
  ▼
[Layer 3: chat-state.ts]
  │  Loads ~/mulmoclaude/transports/telegram/chats/123.json
  │  → sessionId = "abc-def", role = "general"
  ▼
[Layer 3: commands.ts]
  │  Text doesn't start with "/" → not a command
  ▼
[Layer 3: relay.ts]
  │  Calls startChat({ sessionId: "abc-def", message: "...", … })
  │  Subscribes to session "abc-def" via pub/sub
  ▼
[Layer 4: startChat]
  │  Appends {type:"text", role:"user", message:"..."} to the session jsonl
  │  Marks session running in session-store
  │  Spawns runAgentInBackground() in the background
  ▼
[Layer 5: Claude CLI subprocess]
  │  Receives prompt, decides to call the web_search plugin
  │  Plugin returns search results about today's weather
  │  Claude drafts a reply and emits text chunks
  ▼
[Layer 4: pub/sub]
  │  Each text chunk publishes to the "session:abc-def" channel
  │  Final done event on completion
  ▼
[Layer 3: relay.ts]
  │  Subscriber collects chunks into fullReply = "Sunny with some clouds"
  │  done event triggers finalize()
  │  Persists updated claudeSessionId back to chat-state
  │  Returns { kind: "success", reply: "Sunny with some clouds" }
  ▼
[Layer 2: telegram/api.ts]
  │  Calls telegramApi.sendMessage(chatId: 123, text: "Sunny…")
  ▼
[Telegram's server]
  │  Delivers to the phone
  ▼
[Phone — Telegram app]
     "Sunny with some clouds"
```

Thirteen steps — but only steps at Layers 2 and 3 are **new code**.
Everything from "startChat" onwards already exists and is shared with
the Web UI unchanged.

## The two-session-ID model

One detail that trips up new contributors: MulmoClaude carries **two**
session IDs, and they live at different layers with different lifetimes.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 3 chat-state (~/mulmoclaude/transports/…) │
│   externalChatId: "123"                         │
│   sessionId: "abc-def"        ──┐                │
│   claudeSessionId: "xyz-789" ──┐ │                │
└───────────────────────────────┼─┼───────────────┘
                                │ │
┌───────────────────────────────▼─┼───────────────┐
│ Layer 4 session-store + jsonl   │                 │
│   sessionId "abc-def"           │                 │
│   Persistent — lives as long    │                 │
│   as the jsonl file exists.     │                 │
│   Shared between Telegram and   │                 │
│   the Web UI (same sidebar).    │                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┼───────────────┘
                                  │
┌─────────────────────────────────▼───────────────┐
│ Layer 5 Claude CLI process                       │
│   claudeSessionId "xyz-789"                      │
│   Volatile — held in the claude CLI's internal   │
│   conversation state. Disappears on CLI restart, │
│   TTL expiry, or crash.                          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **`sessionId`** is the MulmoClaude identity of the conversation. It
  owns the jsonl file, appears in the sidebar, and persists forever
  unless explicitly deleted.
- **`claudeSessionId`** is the Claude CLI's identifier for resuming
  its own in-memory conversation state. It's optional — if we pass
  it to `startChat()`, the CLI resumes; if not, it starts a fresh
  conversation context.

When `claudeSessionId` becomes stale (CLI restarted between messages,
process crashed, TTL elapsed), the CLI returns `"No conversation found
with session ID: xyz-789"`. The `sessionId` is still intact — we just
need to drop the stale claudeSessionId and let the CLI start a new
conversation. This is issue #211 territory, and the fail-over should
live in Layer 3's `relay.ts` so every transport benefits from it
automatically.

---

## Why `startChat()` and not `runAgent()`

PR #106 tried to do the right thing but picked the wrong entry point.
`runAgent()` is an internal function — it just spawns the Claude
subprocess and relays events. All of the following are **outside** of
`runAgent()`:

- Appending the user message to the jsonl
- Registering the session with the in-memory session-store
- Setting the "session running" flag so concurrent requests return 409
- Triggering post-run journal / chat-index / wiki-backlinks updates

These responsibilities live in `startChat()` and `runAgentInBackground()`.
Bypassing them means messages appear to "work" (the bot replies) but:

- The session is **invisible** to the sidebar because session-store
  never heard of it
- Nothing is written to the jsonl, so **refreshing the Web UI loses the
  entire conversation**
- Journal aggregation misses the session — it never appears in the
  daily summary
- Chat-index doesn't generate a title, so sidebar entries are unlabeled
- Wiki-backlinks aren't swept, so links from chat content don't
  propagate

`startChat()` exists specifically because these responsibilities are
non-trivial. **The rule of thumb: any new caller that wants to invoke
the agent must go through `startChat()`.** Transports are just one more
kind of caller.

---

## Summary — what to remember

1. **Layers exist so platform code doesn't duplicate agent orchestration.**
   PR #106's mistake was direct `runAgent()` calls, which bypassed all
   the lifecycle hooks that `startChat()` provides.
2. **Layer 2 is per-platform and trivial.** Adding a new platform means
   writing one directory under `server/transports/<name>/` that
   implements `MessagingTransport` and does nothing but talk the
   platform's wire protocol.
3. **Layer 3 is where shared logic lives.** `chat-state.ts` (mapping),
   `commands.ts` (slash commands), `relay.ts` (bridge to `startChat()`),
   and the session model (one active pointer per chat). Write once,
   reuse across transports.
4. **One chat = one active session pointer.** A messaging chat always
   points to exactly one MulmoClaude session. `/reset` creates a new
   session and moves the pointer. `/connect` from the Web UI reassigns
   the pointer to an existing browser session. Old sessions are never
   deleted — they remain in the sidebar.
5. **Layer 4 is the Web UI's existing entry point.** Messaging
   transports don't modify it — they just call `startChat()` like the
   Web UI does.
6. **Two session IDs, two layers.** `sessionId` = persistent, lives in
   Layer 4's jsonl. `claudeSessionId` = volatile, lives in Layer 5's CLI
   process. Recovery when the volatile one dies belongs in Layer 3.
7. **The Web UI and messaging transports share everything below Layer
   3.** A session started on Telegram appears in the Web UI sidebar
   automatically, because session-store doesn't care who the caller was.
