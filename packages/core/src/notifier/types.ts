/** Two notification shapes, distinguished by who fires the close call:
 *
 *    `fyi`    — informational. The host (bell panel) clears it when the
 *               user dismisses the row. No deep-link target.
 *    `action` — pending obligation. The plugin clears it when the
 *               underlying domain state changes (the user paid the tax,
 *               viewed the digest, etc.). The bell row navigates to
 *               `navigateTarget` on click.
 *
 *  The engine reads `lifecycle` only to enforce two publish-time rules
 *  (everything downstream — pubsub fan-out, persistence, history — is
 *  lifecycle-blind):
 *
 *    1. `action` requires a non-empty `navigateTarget`. Without one,
 *       clicking the row does nothing and the entry is a degraded fyi.
 *    2. `action` cannot use `info` severity. A low-priority obligation
 *       is incoherent — fyi if it's a ping, `nudge`/`urgent` if it's a
 *       real obligation worth a landing page.
 *
 *  Both rules are mirrored in the HTTP layer so plugin-runtime callers
 *  and HTTP callers hit the same wall. */
