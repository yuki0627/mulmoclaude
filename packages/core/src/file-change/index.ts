// @mulmoclaude/core/file-change — shared "this workspace file changed"
// broadcaster. A host write route calls `publishFileChange(relPath)` after a
// successful write; subscribed UI tabs refetch. Extracted so MulmoClaude and
// MulmoTerminal forward to the SAME plugin-scoped channels (the live-refresh
// contract the markdown/html Views subscribe to) without duplicating the logic.
//
// Everything host-specific is INJECTED via `configureFileChangePublisher` (the
// pubsub, the workspace root, the path→posix normaliser, the host's own primary
// channel, the plugin-scope matchers, and any side-effect), so this package owns
// only the orchestration + the `plugin:<scope>:file:<path>` channel format and
// touches neither host's pubsub-channel config nor its frontend subscribers.
