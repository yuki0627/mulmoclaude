// categories users need to record their first opening balance and
// post their first entries, without overwhelming a brand-new user.
//
// A second tier of `active: false` entries is included so the user
// can flip on common-but-not-universal accounts (Inventory, Travel,
// Depreciation Expense, …) from Manage Accounts with one click
// rather than typing them in by hand. Inactive accounts stay
// hidden from journal entry / ledger dropdowns until the user
// reactivates them. Tax-related accounts (1400 / 2400) are an
// exception — they ship active by default since almost every
// jurisdiction levies a consumption / sales / VAT tax.
