// Single source of truth for every WebSocket pub/sub channel name
// the app publishes to or subscribes to. Keeping these in one file
// means:
//
//   - a rename is one edit instead of a grep-and-edit across
//     server + client
//   - typo-wise, publisher and subscriber can't drift (both import
//     the same const / factory)
//   - a new channel gets declared here first, then wired — the
//     declaration serves as a lightweight registry / audit list
//
// **Aggregator shape**: plugins that own static channels declare
// them in their `meta.ts` under `staticChannels` and the host
// auto-merges via `BUILT_IN_PLUGIN_METAS`. Channel factories
// (e.g. `bookChannel(bookId)`) stay as named exports in each
// plugin's meta.ts because their signatures are plugin-specific —
// re-exported below under the existing public names.
//
// First slice of issue #289 (item 6: pub-sub channels).
