// Vue-router setup (history mode — clean URLs without #).
//
// The route is /chat/:sessionId? which captures the session the user
// was looking at. Everything else (view mode, file path, result uuid,
// role) lives in query parameters and will be wired in later phases.
//
// The "/" → "/chat" redirect ensures a fresh browser tab always lands
// on the chat view with the default (new) session, matching the
// current pre-router behaviour.
//
// History mode requires the server to serve index.html for any path
// that doesn't match an API route or static file. In production the
// Express catch-all `app.get("*", ...)` in server/index.ts already
// does this. In dev, Vite's default SPA fallback handles it.
