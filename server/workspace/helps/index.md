# About MulmoClaude

MulmoClaude is a GUI front-end for Claude Code. It lets you talk to Claude Code through a chat interface with rich visual output, powered by the **GUI Chat Protocol** — a plugin layer that allows Claude to render structured results (documents, spreadsheets, mind maps, images, and more) directly in the canvas alongside the conversation.

Under the hood it uses the Claude Code Agent SDK as its LLM core. Claude has full access to your workspace files and can use built-in tools (read, write, bash, search) as well as GUI Chat Protocol plugins registered as MCP servers.

**Core philosophy**: The workspace is the database. Files are the source of truth. Claude is the intelligent interface.

## Roles

- **General** — Everyday assistant: task management, scheduling, wiki, mind maps, and general Q&A.
- **Office** — Creates documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and MulmoScript slideshows.
- **Guide & Planner** — Collects your needs via a form, then produces a rich illustrated guide or plan. Works for recipes, travel itineraries, fitness programs, event planning, study guides, DIY projects, and more.
- **Artist** — Generates and edits images, opens a drawing canvas, and creates 3D scenes.
- **Tutor** — Assesses your knowledge level, then teaches any topic with structured documents and visuals.
- **Storyteller** — Crafts illustrated narrative stories as a MulmoScript storyboard.
- **Storyteller Plus** — Like Storyteller, with consistent character images across beats.
- **Role Manager** — Create, edit, and delete custom roles.
- *(Additional roles may be defined by the user in the workspace.)*

## Wiki — Long-Term Memory

The wiki (`wiki/` in the workspace) acts as Claude's long-term memory. Unlike the conversation history which resets each session, the wiki is a persistent, compounding knowledge base that Claude builds and maintains over time. You feed it sources — articles, URLs, notes — and Claude ingests them into structured, interlinked Markdown pages. The more you add, the smarter it gets.

See [Wiki](helps/wiki.md) for details on how it works.
