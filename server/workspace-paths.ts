// Single source of truth for workspace directory / file names and
// their absolute paths. Before this module, ~15 call sites each
// wrote `path.join(workspacePath, "wiki")` / "markdowns" / etc. by
// hand — renaming a directory meant grep-and-edit across the
// server, with no typecheck help against typos.
//
// **This module does not change any paths.** Every name here is
// the string that was previously baked into its call site, so
// centralizing is a pure source-level refactor — no files move.
// The layout rethink + migration that issue #284 proposes will
// happen on top of this, by re-mapping the values below.
//
// When adding a new top-level directory: add the name to the
// `WORKSPACE_DIRS` record below. The absolute path is derived
// automatically via `WORKSPACE_PATHS`.
