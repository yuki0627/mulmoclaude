# Bridge Protocol

**Audience:** anyone writing a new bridge process — a program that
glues one external messaging platform (Telegram, LINE, Slack,
Discord, the CLI, a web page, …) to MulmoClaude's chat service.

This is the wire-level contract. It is deliberately small: a
bridge is ~100–200 lines of platform-side code plus the boilerplate
covered here. The boilerplate for TypeScript bridges is already
wrapped in [`@mulmobridge/client`](../packages/client/).
Non-Node implementations (Python, Go, anything with a socket.io
4.x client) can follow this document directly.

For the architectural context (why bridges are separate processes,
how they fit into the five layers), see
[`plans/messaging_layers_guide.md`](../plans/messaging_layers_guide.md).

## Transport

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Protocol | [socket.io](https://socket.io) 4.x |
| Path | `/ws/chat` |
| Default host | `http://localhost:3001` (server binds `127.0.0.1` only) |
| Transport | `websocket` (long-polling skipped — loopback always upgrades) |

The server is written with `socket.io` 4.8.x. Clients **must** be
major-compatible. `socket.io-client` at the same major version is
the easy path in Node; most other languages have a community
implementation that tracks protocol v5.

## Authentication

Every bridge needs the current server bearer token (#272). Two
ways to resolve it, in this order:

1. `MULMOCLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. Set this
   explicitly when running the bridge on a different host than the
   server, or when pinning the token across server restarts (#316).
2. `<homedir>/mulmoclaude/.session-token`. The server writes this
   at startup, `chmod 0600`. Read it as UTF-8, trim whitespace.

If neither yields a non-empty string, exit with a message pointing
the user at `yarn dev` / `MULMOCLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN`.

---

## Handshake

Connect with `auth: { transportId, token }`:

```ts
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("http://localhost:3001", {
  path: "/ws/chat",
  auth: {
    transportId: "cli",     // required — identifies your bridge
    token: "<bearer token>", // required when the server has auth on
  },
  transports: ["websocket"],
});
```

### Required fields

- `transportId: string` — non-empty. Stable identifier per bridge
  family (`cli`, `telegram`, `line`, `slack`, `discord-mybot`, …).
  Used to scope per-bridge chat state on disk
  (`~/mulmoclaude/transports/<transportId>/…`) and as the
  server→bridge push room key.
- `token: string` — the bearer token from the workspace file / env
  var. Required when the server is configured with auth (the
  default).

### Rejection cases

The server emits `connect_error` with one of these messages. A
bridge should pattern-match these exact strings to give the user a
useful recovery hint:

| Message | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `transportId is required` | `auth.transportId` missing / empty / non-string | Check your handshake payload |
| `token is required` | Server has auth on; `auth.token` missing | Set `MULMOCLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` or ensure `.session-token` is readable |
| `invalid token` | Provided token ≠ current server token | Server was restarted — re-read the token and reconnect |
| `server auth not ready` | Server process booting; token not yet written | Retry in a second |
| `handshake auth is required` | `auth` absent entirely | Pass an `auth` object to `io(...)` |

Anything else is a platform-level connection error (network, TLS,
wrong port). Surface it verbatim.

## Events

### `message` — bridge → server (with ack)

Send a user turn. Use socket.io's built-in ack callback to await
the reply:

```ts
socket
  .timeout(6 * 60 * 1000) // > server's 5-minute reply timeout
  .emit(
    "message",
    { externalChatId: "terminal", text: "hello" },
    (err, ack) => { /* ... */ },
  );
```

Payload:

- `externalChatId: string` — non-empty. Your platform's chat /
  conversation identifier. For Telegram this is the `chat.id`; for
  Slack a channel ID; for a CLI a fixed string like `"terminal"`.
  The server uses `(transportId, externalChatId)` as the key for
  chat state (which claude session to route into, last-role, last-
  activity timestamp).
- `text: string` — non-empty. The user's message, UTF-8. Trim
  leading / trailing whitespace yourself if you care; the server
  trims before dispatching.
- `attachments?: Attachment[]` — optional array of file
  attachments (#382). Each entry has `{ mimeType: string, data:
  string, filename?: string }` where `data` is base64-encoded
  content. The server filters by mimeType: `image/*` becomes
  vision content blocks for Claude; other types are logged and
  skipped for now. Multiple images are supported (one content
  block per attachment).

Ack shape:

```ts
type MessageAck =
  | { ok: true; reply: string }
  | { ok: false; error: string; status?: number };
```

- `reply` — assistant text. May be empty string if the assistant
  finished without producing text (e.g. a tool-only turn).
- `error` — human-readable reason. `status` mirrors the HTTP path's
  status code where meaningful (`400` for validation, `500` for
  internal, `409` is turned into `ok: true` with a "please wait"
  reply).

Timeout strategy: the server uses a 5-minute reply timeout. Use a
client-side timeout slightly longer (6 minutes in `_lib/client.ts`)
so the server's timeout wins and you get a textual reply rather
than a client-side cancellation.

### `push` — server → bridge (Phase B of #268)

Subscribe:

```ts
socket.on("push", ({ chatId, message }) => {
  // Deliver via your platform. Telegram:
  //   telegramSendMessage(BOT_TOKEN, chatId, message)
  // CLI just prints.
});
```

Payload: `{ chatId: string; message: string }`.

- `chatId` — the externalChatId the server-side scheduler /
  task-manager wants to reach.
- `message` — the text to deliver verbatim. The server has no
  knowledge of your platform's markup flavor.

No ack. Push delivery is best-effort at the socket layer. If the
bridge needs "delivered" confirmation, a future phase will add a
`push.ack` callback; until then, platform-side confirmation (e.g.
Telegram's `sendMessage` response) is the closest equivalent.

**Room semantics:** each connected bridge auto-joins
`bridge:${transportId}`. Multiple bridges with the same transportId
all receive the same pushes. If no bridge is connected at push
time, the server queues the message in-memory per transport; the
next bridge to connect drains that transport's queue to *its* own
socket (not to the room — so a second late-joining bridge doesn't
re-receive already-drained messages).

---

## Minimal TypeScript bridge

```ts
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("http://localhost:3001", {
  path: "/ws/chat",
  auth: {
    transportId: "demo",
    token: process.env.MULMOCLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN!,
  },
  transports: ["websocket"],
});

socket.on("connect", () => console.log(`Connected: ${socket.id}`));
socket.on("connect_error", (err) => console.error(err.message));
socket.on("push", (ev) => console.log(`[push] ${ev.chatId}: ${ev.message}`));

// Send a turn
await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
  socket.timeout(360_000).emit(
    "message",
    { externalChatId: "test", text: "Hello" },
    (err, ack) => {
      if (err) console.error(`timeout: ${err.message}`);
      else console.log(ack);
      resolve();
    },
  );
});
```

For the production-grade TS version with error paths baked in, use
`createBridgeClient` from [`@mulmobridge/client`](../packages/client/)
— `packages/cli/src/index.ts` is a ~40-line example built on top of it.

---

## Operational notes

- **Server restart invalidates the token.** Every bridge caches it
  at startup. After a server bounce, the bridge sees
  `invalid token` and must re-read the token. For long-running
  bridges, pin the token with `MULMOCLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` on both
  sides (#316).
- **Bridges are stateless.** All chat state lives server-side under
  `~/mulmoclaude/transports/<transportId>/chats/<externalChatId>.json`.
  A bridge can be killed and restarted freely.
- **One bridge process per platform.** Run multiple bridges
  concurrently (`yarn cli` plus a Telegram bridge plus …) — they're
  independent processes sharing only the server.
- **Platform-specific concerns are yours.** Rate limits, message
  length caps, markdown flavor, typing indicators, reply-token
  expiry (LINE) — the server doesn't know. Handle them in your
  bridge.
