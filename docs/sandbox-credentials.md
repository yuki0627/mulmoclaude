# Sandbox Host Credentials

By default, the MulmoClaude Docker sandbox is **credential-free**. The container has `git` and `gh` installed, but no SSH keys, no GitHub token, no git identity — so `git pull` over SSH, `gh issue list`, or `git commit --signoff` all fail inside the container.

This page describes the two opt-in mechanisms for giving the sandbox just enough credentials to authenticate, without leaking the underlying secrets.

> **Before you turn anything on, read [What we do NOT do](#what-we-do-not-do) and [What we cannot do](#what-we-cannot-do) below.** Both mechanisms are safe by design, but the safety relies on understanding the scope.

---

## Quick start

Add one or both to your `.env` (or shell environment):

```env
# Forward the host's SSH agent into the container.
# Private keys stay on the host; only the signing oracle is exposed.
SANDBOX_SSH_AGENT_FORWARD=1

# Mount allowlisted config files/dirs read-only.
# See the table below for the names you can put here.
SANDBOX_MOUNT_CONFIGS=gh,gitconfig
```

Restart the server. On the next agent run you should see a log line like:

```text
INFO  [sandbox] host credentials attached to container mounts=["gh (GitHub CLI auth token + hosts config)","gitconfig (...)","ssh-agent forward"]
```

Inside the container (you can verify by running an agent task that executes shell commands):

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com   # should authenticate via the forwarded agent
gh auth status          # should show your host's gh login
git config --global user.email
```

---

## Mechanism 1 — SSH agent forward

Set `SANDBOX_SSH_AGENT_FORWARD=1`.

**What it does.** Forwards the host SSH agent into the container so `git`, `ssh`, and anything else that speaks the agent protocol can authenticate using the host's keys. **Your private key bytes never enter the container.**

On macOS, Docker Desktop's built-in magic socket (`/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock`) is used. On Linux, the host's `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is bind-mounted directly.

**Host whitelist (security).** By default, the forwarded agent is restricted to `github.com` only — the container cannot use your keys to SSH into other servers. To allow additional hosts:

```bash
SANDBOX_SSH_ALLOWED_HOSTS=github.com,gitlab.com,bitbucket.org
```

The entrypoint generates a restrictive `~/.ssh/config` inside the container (SSH is first-match-wins, so whitelisted hosts come first):
```
Host github.com
  IdentityAgent /ssh-agent    # exception: agent allowed

Host *
  IdentityAgent none          # catch-all: agent blocked
```

**Prerequisites on the host:**

- An SSH agent is running and `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is set (Linux only; macOS agent is automatic).
- Your keys have been added (`ssh-add`). Passphrase-protected keys need to be unlocked once on the host before starting the server — the container has no TTY to prompt for a passphrase.

**Skipped automatically (with a `log.warn`) when:**

- Linux: `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is not set or the socket path doesn't exist.
- macOS: never skipped (Docker Desktop's magic socket is always available).

The server doesn't fail — it just logs the reason and continues without the forward.

## Mechanism 2 — Allowlisted config mounts

Set `SANDBOX_MOUNT_CONFIGS=<names>` to a comma-separated list of names from the table below. Each name is a server-side key that resolves to a fixed host path and container path. **Users cannot pass arbitrary paths** — unknown names are logged as warnings and ignored.

### Allowlist

| Name | Host path | Container path | Kind | What it enables |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gh` | `~/.config/gh` | `/home/node/.config/gh` | dir | `gh` CLI (`gh issue list`, `gh pr create`, etc.). Also makes `git push` to GitHub over HTTPS work via the `gh` credential helper. |
| `gitconfig` | `~/.gitconfig` | `/home/node/.gitconfig` | file | `user.name`, `user.email`, signing key, global aliases. Needed to let `git commit` record an author identity. |

All mounts are **read-only** (`:ro`). The container cannot write back to your host config.

### Adding a new tool

Extending the list is a code change, not a user config. This is deliberate — the allowlist is the security boundary. To add an entry:

1. Append a row to `ALLOWED` in [`server/agent/sandboxMounts.ts`](../server/agent/sandboxMounts.ts), specifying `name`, `hostPath`, `containerPath`, `kind`, and `description`.
2. Add a row to the table above.
3. Think about what the mount exposes and write a short "What it enables" sentence. If the expose is wider than `gh`-level (e.g. tokens for multiple hosts, or a key used for more than one service), consider whether it deserves its own env var instead of riding on `SANDBOX_MOUNT_CONFIGS`.

## What we do NOT do

- **We do not mount `~/.ssh`.** Direct filesystem access to private keys would defeat the point of the sandbox. Use `SANDBOX_SSH_AGENT_FORWARD=1` instead.
- **We do not mount `~/.git-credentials`.** That file contains plaintext HTTPS tokens for *any* host; the blast radius is unbounded. If you need HTTPS for a specific service, set it up through that service's CLI (like `gh`) and mount the CLI's config dir instead.
- **We do not support cloud-provider CLIs (`gcloud`, `aws`, Azure) today.** They're intentionally out of scope — larger attack surface, different threat model. A future issue can revisit this if concrete demand appears.
- **We do not resolve symlinks for you.** If `~/.config/gh` is a symlink to a path outside your home directory, Docker will follow it and mount the target. Check that your config dirs are not symlinked to secrets you don't mean to expose.
- **The read-only flag is not tamper-proof against a malicious image.** The sandbox runs images we build from `Dockerfile.sandbox`. If you replace that image with something hostile, it can read the mounted credentials. The point of the opt-in is to keep *unmodified-Claude-Code* safe, not to defend against a compromised container.

## What we cannot do

- **macOS Keychain-backed credentials.** Git's `osxkeychain` helper, iTerm's SSH keychain integration, and Apple-signed SSH keys in the system keychain all require macOS APIs that aren't mountable. If your GitHub token is only in Keychain, run `gh auth login` once with the `file` credential store to get a mountable `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`. Same for Windows `wincred`.
- **Passphrase prompts.** Neither mechanism gives the container a TTY. If an SSH key is passphrase-protected and not yet unlocked in the agent, the sign request fails silently. Unlock once on the host (`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) before starting the server.
- **Interactive 2FA (`gh auth login`, `aws configure sso`).** The container can't drive a browser-based device flow. Do the login on the host; the resulting config is what the mount exposes.
- **Remote bridge / multi-user setups.** This whole page assumes the machine running MulmoClaude is the same machine whose credentials you want to expose. If a future feature lets MulmoClaude run on a remote box, the credentials story is different and this doc does not cover it.

## Troubleshooting

**`gh auth status` inside the container says "not logged in", but the mount is set.**
- The server logged `config mount skipped (host path missing) name=gh hostPath=...`: your `~/.config/gh` doesn't exist on the host. Run `gh auth login` on the host first.
- The mount is present but the `.config/gh/hosts.yml` file is writable only by root or a different user. Docker preserves uid/gid; the container runs as your host uid. Run `ls -l ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` and confirm it's readable by you.

**`git push` over SSH fails with `Permission denied (publickey)`.**
- Confirm `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is set inside the container: the startup log line should list `ssh-agent forward`. If it's not listed, the server logged a `SSH agent forward requested but skipped` warning with the reason.
- Run `ssh-add -l` on the host — if it says "The agent has no identities", nothing is available to forward.

**`git commit` inside the container errors with `Please tell me who you are`.**
- You haven't mounted `gitconfig`. Either add it to `SANDBOX_MOUNT_CONFIGS` or let Claude set a per-repo identity with `git config user.email` inside the workspace.

**I turned both flags on and see no extra mounts in `docker inspect`.**
- Check the server log at startup for `unknown SANDBOX_MOUNT_CONFIGS entries ignored` — you may have a typo in the env var (`ghub`, `git-config`, etc. are not recognised; only the names in the allowlist table above).
- `DISABLE_SANDBOX=1` also disables the sandbox entirely — in that case `git` and `gh` run on the host and use your host credentials directly, which is why the mounts look absent.
