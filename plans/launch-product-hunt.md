# MulmoClaude — Product Hunt Launch Strategy

**Owner:** CMO (strategy), Engineering (demo assets), Community (day-of ops)
**Target launch:** Tuesday, one week out — 12:01 AM PT kickoff
**Positioning one-liner:** *Claude Code that produces docs, presentations, spreadsheets, videos, and remembers everything.*
**Core thesis (the story behind the product):** This is the first visible surface of an AI-native operating system. Claude Code is the kernel; MulmoClaude is the shell, the compositor, and the filesystem users actually see. **The unique thing isn't any single feature — it's the *location.*** Web articles, chat conversations, local files, scheduled runs, phone messages all converge into one local folder (`~/mulmoclaude/`), as plain Markdown, maintained by AI. It's the reinvention of the home directory for the AI era.
**Target early adopter (one audience, not four):** Claude Code power users who have already hit the limits of the terminal. Everyone else — productivity users, knowledge workers, AI enthusiasts — is phase 2 and will come via these users, not in parallel to them.

---

## 1. Positioning & Tagline

### Primary tagline (Product Hunt hero line)

> **MulmoClaude — Claude Code that produces docs, presentations, spreadsheets, videos, and remembers everything.**

This one sentence is the whole product. The concrete noun list (docs, presentations, spreadsheets, videos) does the work — a viewer knows in half a second what they're going to get back. "Remembers everything" is the moat. Every surface — hero video, PH headline, tweet #1, gallery captions — must trace back to it. Everything else (parallel sessions, bridges, sandbox, roles, skills, charts) is *evidence*, not the message.

**Drafting rule:** whenever you're tempted to write "artifacts," write the concrete list instead. Abstractions lose upvotes.

### Supporting taglines (A/B candidates for social + hero imagery)

1. *Docs. Presentations. Spreadsheets. Videos. Out of Claude Code. And it remembers.*
2. *Claude Code that produces the things you actually ship — and gets smarter every chat.*
3. *Turn any research paper into a document, a deck, and a narrated video — without opening anything else.*
4. *Run five Claude Code agents in one browser tab. Get documents, decks, and videos back — not text.*
5. *`~/mulmoclaude/` — a local knowledge base that grows itself. Web, files, conversations — all here. Reach it from anywhere.* **(Geek-targeted; use on HN, X-dev, terminal-native audiences.)**

### Category pick

Primary: **Developer Tools** · Secondary: **Artificial Intelligence**
Dev Tools is where our one audience (Claude Code power users) lives. We skip Productivity entirely — chasing two audiences on PH day means landing neither. AI is a defensive tertiary at most.

---

## 2. The One-Sentence Pitch

**MulmoClaude turns Claude Code into a system that produces real documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and narrated videos, runs multiple agents at once, and builds a personal knowledge base from everything you do.**

Three clauses, in the order a user asks them: *What does it make? How fast? Does it get smarter?* Everything else in this plan is supporting evidence.

### The deeper frame (use when the viewer is ready for more)

> **An AI-built workspace that grows itself. Research, organizing, file management — all automatic. Reach it from anywhere. All local, all yours.**

The real differentiator is not any feature — it's the **location**. Web articles (via source crawling), chat conversations (via automatic wiki extraction), local files (via the file explorer), scheduled runs, phone messages — *everything converges into one folder*, as plain Markdown, maintained by Claude. Notion is cloud. Google Drive is cloud. Obsidian is local but the AI doesn't grow it for you. MulmoClaude is **all three properties in one place: local, AI-maintained, multi-source.**

### The anti-wrapper line (use this whenever "is it just a ChatGPT clone?" shows up)

> **This doesn't call the Claude API. It runs Claude Code directly — your auth, your tools, your files, your environment.**

That distinction is the whole reason the product can do what it does. Repeat it verbatim in the maker post, the HN title, and tweet #1.

---

## 3. Why This Wins on Product Hunt

Product Hunt voters reward three things: **a clear "aha"**, **a short demo**, and **a narrative that isn't another wrapper**. MulmoClaude lands all three:

| Hunt instinct                  | MulmoClaude's answer                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Is this just a ChatGPT clone?"| No — it rides on Claude Code (local auth, your filesystem, your tools), not an API wrapper.               |
| "What's the new idea?"         | **One folder holds everything** — web articles, chats, files, scheduled runs — as Markdown, AI-maintained. It's the home directory reinvented. |
| "Isn't that just Notion / Obsidian?" | Notion is cloud. Obsidian is local but doesn't grow itself. MulmoClaude is **local + AI-maintained + multi-source** — all three, in one place. |
| "Can I try it in 60 seconds?"  | Hosted demo at `demo.mulmoclaude.com`. No signup, no cloud account, no vendor lock-in.                   |
| "Why should I care tomorrow?"  | Every chat, every crawled article, every scheduled run **lands in the same folder** and gets wired into the wiki. It compounds. |

---

## 4. Key Messages (collapsed from 9 to 5, reordered)

A PH viewer skims for ~10 seconds and remembers one idea. So we drop to **five** messages, in the order a user's brain actually asks the question. Everything else (roles, skills, bridges-as-feature-list, Markdown storage) is supporting evidence — keep in reserve for the comment thread and FAQ, not the hero copy.

### The five (rank-ordered)

1. **Docs, presentations, spreadsheets, videos — not text.** Claude Code answers with **real documents, narrated slide decks, spreadsheets, ECharts dashboards, and AI-generated videos** (MulmoScript / MulmoCast: Gemini image + Veo 3.1 video + audio narration). Not a chat bubble. This is what "multi-modal" actually means — powered by the open GUI Chat Protocol.
2. **Parallel Claude Code, in one browser tab.** Run **many sessions at once** — one generates a video, another refactors code, a third drafts email. Claude Code is no longer single-threaded. *This is the category-defining shot for the hero video.*
3. **Everything in one folder, growing itself.** Web articles (via source crawling), chat conversations, local files, scheduled runs, phone messages — *all converge into one local folder* (`~/mulmoclaude/`), as plain Markdown, cross-linked and maintained by Claude itself. Karpathy's *LLM Knowledge Bases* idea, shipped. **This is the moat, and it's about place, not feature:** Notion is cloud; Obsidian is local but inert; MulmoClaude is **local + AI-maintained + multi-source** — all three at once. Every other Claude client starts from zero; MulmoClaude compounds, because every input lands in the same place.
4. **Your phone is a Claude Code client.** Bridges to Telegram, Slack, LINE, Discord, WhatsApp, Matrix — same agent, same workspace, same wiki. Fire a task from the subway, see the document (or the video) waiting on your laptop.
5. **Sandboxed, so you can trust it.** Claude Code has filesystem access — that's the whole point and the whole risk. MulmoClaude auto-runs Claude in a **Docker container that only sees your workspace**. SSH keys, `.env` files, home directory: invisible. No configuration, no permissions dialogs. *Reframe AGPL + Docker as "serious enough to be safe," not "complicated."*

### Kept in reserve (don't lead with these — they're comment-thread fuel)

- Roles (General, Office, Guide & Planner, Artist, Tutor, Storyteller, MulmoCaster) — mention only when someone asks *"what can it do?"*
- Skills launcher + SKILL.md scheduling — a Claude-Code-insider wink, save for HN.
- Markdown-as-database / workspace portability — powers the "gets smarter" story; surface only if someone probes on lock-in.
- ECharts, file attachments, DOCX/XLSX/PPTX — individual features, not the pitch.

```
Hi Product Hunt 👋

I'm Satoshi Nakajima. I spent eight years at Microsoft working on
operating systems (lead architect on early Windows releases), then
spent the last year obsessing over a single question: **what does an
AI-native OS actually look like?**

I don't think it's ChatGPT. I don't think it's Copilot. I think the
kernel is something like Claude Code — an agent with direct access to
your files, your tools, your environment. Powerful, but living inside
a terminal.

Terminals were the OS shell of 1975. We can do better.

MulmoClaude is my attempt at the **shell for that new kernel**. It
does three things:

**1. Claude replies with real documents, decks, spreadsheets, and videos — not text.**
Documents, spreadsheets, ECharts dashboards, forms, 3D scenes — and
full narrated slide decks and AI-generated videos via the built-in
MulmoScript / MulmoCast engine (Gemini image + Veo 3.1 video +
audio). Drop in a research paper, get back a summary doc, a deck, and
a narrated video. No other tools opened.

**2. It runs many Claude Code agents in parallel, in one browser tab.**
Kick off a video render in one session, refactor code in another,
draft an email in a third. While one is working, you keep working.
Claude Code is no longer single-threaded.

**3. It gets smarter every conversation.**
Every ingested article, every decision, every fact becomes a
cross-linked page in a personal wiki Claude builds and maintains
itself (inspired by @karpathy's *LLM Knowledge Bases* post). It's
all plain Markdown in `~/mulmoclaude/` — git-friendly, portable,
yours. This is the part I'm proudest of: **every other Claude client
starts from zero; this one compounds.**

Two details that matter:

- **Not a wrapper.** This doesn't call the Claude API. It runs the
  actual Claude Code CLI — your auth, your filesystem, your skills,
  your MCP servers. That's why it can do what it does.
- **Sandboxed by default.** Claude runs inside a Docker container
  that only sees your workspace. SSH keys, `.env` files, home
  directory — invisible. Auto-detected on launch, no configuration.

You can also reach the same workspace from Telegram, Slack, LINE,
Discord, WhatsApp, Matrix — same agent, same wiki memory. Fire a
task from the subway, see the result on your laptop.

Open source, AGPL.

If you're already a Claude Code power user who's hit the walls of
the terminal, this is built for you. Would love your honest feedback
— this is the first visible surface of a much bigger thesis about
what computing looks like when AI is the kernel.

— Satoshi
```

### Description / gallery captions (one per screenshot)

Cut from 9 to 6. Each one maps to one of the five key messages (plus the shock demo). No orphans.

1. **The shock demo** — "Drop in a research paper. Out comes a summary document, a slide deck, and a narrated video. No other tools opened." *(Leads the gallery because it's the ‘wait, it does THAT?' moment.)*
2. **Parallel sessions (hero)** — "Three Claude Code sessions running at once, one browser tab. One renders a video, one builds a spreadsheet, one drafts email."
3. **Docs, decks, spreadsheets, videos — not text** — "Claude Code's answer isn't a chat bubble. It's a document, a deck, a spreadsheet, a chart, or a narrated video you can edit and keep."
4. **Everything in one folder** — "Web articles, chats, local files, scheduled runs — all converge into `~/mulmoclaude/` as Markdown, maintained by Claude. The home directory, reinvented."
5. **Phone as a client** — "Message Claude from Telegram, LINE, Slack, WhatsApp. Send a photo from the subway, get a document back on your laptop."
6. **Sandboxed by default** — "Docker auto-detected. Claude only sees your workspace. SSH keys, .env files, home directory — invisible."

---

## 6. Demo Video Plan

Three videos — each serves a different channel. **Always record silent first; add a single-voice narration pass; ship captions.**

### Video A — The 60-second hero (Product Hunt gallery + Twitter/X)

- **Goal:** earn one upvote per viewer. No feature-listing.
- **The single moment we must land:** split-screen with three Claude Code sessions running simultaneously, one of them producing a narrated MulmoCast video from a dropped-in research paper. That shot is the entire pitch in one frame.
- **The shock demo (opener):** drag a real research paper PDF into one session → out comes a **summary document + slide deck + narrated video**. Not a water-cycle explainer. A real artifact people in our target audience would actually want.
- **Structure:**
  - 0:00–0:05 — Cold open: hand drags a PDF (visibly labeled "Attention Is All You Need" or similar) onto the browser. No logo, no title card.
  - 0:05–0:20 — Split-screen snaps to three sessions. Session 1 (largest): the paper → summary doc → deck → MulmoCast narrated video with Veo 3.1 clips. Session 2: a spreadsheet being built from pasted CSV. Session 3: ECharts candlestick appears. **All running at the same time, no cuts, no spinner waits.**
  - 0:20–0:30 — Caption overlay: *"Every conversation makes the next one smarter."* Zoom on the wiki sidebar: a new page appears, cross-linked to two existing ones.
  - 0:30–0:40 — Phone enters frame: a Telegram message to the same workspace → laptop canvas updates live. Caption: *"Your phone is a Claude Code client."*
  - 0:40–0:50 — Docker sandbox banner on screen. Caption: *"Sandboxed. Claude only sees your workspace."*
  - 0:50–0:55 — Anti-wrapper beat. Single white-on-black frame: *"This is not an API wrapper. This is Claude Code — with a shell."*
  - 0:55–1:00 — Logo + github URL + one-line install. **No install command on-screen if we're shipping a hosted demo** (see §10.5); instead, "try it in your browser: demo.mulmoclaude.com".
- **Production notes:** 1080p screen capture, 24fps, no zoom transitions, monospace captions. Music: one royalty-free lo-fi track at 40% — cut it at 0:55. **Non-negotiable:** zero spinner time. Pre-render, splice, don't wait.

### Video B — The 3-minute deep-dive (YouTube + landing page)

- **Goal:** convert a developer watcher into a `git clone` (or a hosted-demo click).
- **Narrative arc:** *What does it make? How fast? Does it get smarter? Can I trust it?* — exactly the order the user's brain asks.
- **Outline:**
  - 0:00–0:20 — Problem framing, in Satoshi's voice: "I worked on Windows for eight years. Claude Code is the kernel of an AI-native OS. But kernels need shells. Here's the shell I wanted."
  - 0:20–0:50 — **Shock demo.** Drop a research paper PDF. Out comes a summary document, a slide deck, and a narrated MulmoCast video. Call out: *the answer isn't text, it's an artifact. Powered by GUI Chat Protocol.*
  - 0:50–1:30 — Open two more sessions in parallel. Kick off another MulmoCast video in one, refactor a real codebase in another. Three artifacts produced simultaneously. Call out: *"one browser tab, many Claude Code workers."*
  - 1:30–2:10 — **The compounding moment.** Ingest two related articles. Show wiki backlinks appearing. Open a fresh session tomorrow's simulated morning and ask a question — Claude answers grounded in the wiki it built itself. Call out: *"every other Claude client starts from zero. This one compounds."*
  - 2:10–2:30 — Bridges. Message from **Telegram** and **LINE**; show desktop canvas updating live. Same memory, same workspace.
  - 2:30–2:50 — Trust layer. Docker sandbox banner. Show Claude being *unable* to read a file outside the workspace. Frame against tools that run Claude directly on `~/`. Anti-wrapper line on-screen.
  - 2:50–3:00 — Open source, AGPL. Hosted demo link + github link.
- **Production notes:** talking-head inset bottom-right for the first 20 seconds, then pure screencast.

### Video C — The 15-second loop (Instagram, LinkedIn, PH gallery motion)

- Single prompt → single rich visual result → fade to logo. Meant to be muted.
- Shoot 3 variants: **(a)** three parallel sessions running at once, **(b)** a full MulmoCast narrated video rendering, **(c)** Telegram-to-canvas round trip. Pick the strongest for PH; post the other two on launch day.

### Filming checklist (applies to all)

- Use a clean workspace (fresh `~/mulmoclaude/`) so the file tree isn't cluttered.
- Record at 1920×1080 minimum; export H.264 at 8 Mbps.
- Pre-compose all prompts in a text file — don't let live-typing slow the pace. Paste and hit send.
- Do a dry run with the exact network Claude will hit. Agent latency is the #1 demo killer.
- If a plugin takes >8s to render, **cut the wait** — PH viewers don't forgive dead air.

## 7. Launch Week Timeline (T = launch day)

### T-14 to T-8 — Asset build

- [ ] Finalize hero video, 3-min video, 3× 15s loops, 7 screenshots
- [ ] Register Product Hunt account, link to X, warm up with 2 comments on other launches
- [ ] Line up **4 hunters** who will commit to launch-day engagement. Brief them on the product in a 5-min Loom.
- [ ] Draft all tweets, LinkedIn posts, Reddit posts, HN post
- [ ] QA install on clean macOS, clean Windows WSL, clean Ubuntu — fix any friction
- [ ] Decide: do we ship a `npx create-mulmoclaude` or keep `git clone` as the CTA? **Recommendation: ship the npx wrapper, it halves the install funnel.**

### T-7 — Pre-announce

- [ ] "Coming Tuesday on PH" tweet with the 15s loop (no link)
- [ ] Post in r/ClaudeAI, r/LocalLLaMA teasers — product demos, not launch CTAs (Reddit hates launch posts)
- [ ] DM 10 Claude Code power users you know — ask for a Tuesday morning try + honest feedback

### T-3 — Warm-up

- [ ] Publish a **blog post** on the Karpathy-KB connection: *"What I learned building a personal wiki for Claude."* This is the intellectual anchor.
- [ ] Submit the blog post to HN. Don't mention PH yet.
- [ ] Draft the PH listing in Maker Studio (do **not** publish — just stage)

### T-0 — Launch day

- **00:01 PT** — Publish on PH. First comment goes up within 90 seconds.
- **00:05 PT** — Tweet thread (7 tweets, one per key message). Pin the tweet.
- **00:10 PT** — LinkedIn, Mastodon, Bluesky cross-post (adapted, not copy-pasted)
- **01:00 PT** — HN "Show HN: MulmoClaude — visual GUI + personal wiki for Claude Code"
- **06:00 PT** — Reddit r/ClaudeAI post (value-first, not launch-y — "I built this, here's the wiki memory idea, here's the code")
- **09:00 PT / 12:00 PT / 15:00 PT / 18:00 PT** — Respond to **every** PH comment within 30 minutes. Non-negotiable.
- **17:00 PT** — Mid-day check: if we're not top-10, ship the Telegram bridge demo video as a fresh post and tag @ProductHunt.
- **21:00 PT** — Thank-you post regardless of placement. Name the top commenters.

### T+1 to T+7 — Compound

- Newsletter sends (dev.to, Hacker Newsletter submission, TLDR Dev pitch)
- Record a "Day after launch — what we learned" post. This outperforms the launch itself 30% of the time.
- Start the interview circuit: pitch the Changelog, Latent Space, and the Anthropic community call.

---

## 8. Channel-by-Channel Playbook

### X / Twitter

**Launch thread (7 tweets) — drafts. Order matches the five key messages + shock demo + CTA.**

1. *MulmoClaude is live on Product Hunt today. It's Claude Code that produces docs, presentations, spreadsheets, videos — and remembers everything. Not an API wrapper. It runs Claude Code directly — your auth, your tools, your files. 🧵*
2. **[Shock demo]** *Drop a research paper in. Out comes a summary document, a slide deck, and a narrated video. No other tools opened. [60s video]*
3. **[Parallel sessions]** *Three Claude Code sessions, one browser tab. One renders a video, one refactors code, one drafts email. Claude Code is no longer single-threaded. [multi-session gif]*
4. **[Everything in one folder]** *Web articles, chats, local files, scheduled runs — all converge into one folder (`~/mulmoclaude/`) as Markdown, maintained by Claude itself. Notion is cloud. Obsidian is inert. MulmoClaude is local + AI-maintained + multi-source. The home directory, reinvented. [wiki/folder gif]*
5. **[Phone as client]** *Message the same agent from Telegram, LINE, Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, Matrix. Fire a task from the subway, see the document (or the narrated video) waiting on your laptop. [bridges gif]*
6. **[Trust]** *Claude runs in a Docker sandbox — auto-detected, no configuration. It only sees your workspace. SSH keys, .env, home dir: invisible. This is the level of care a real shell needs. [sandbox screenshot]*
7. *Try it in your browser right now: [hosted demo link]. Or `git clone` it — open source, AGPL. One upvote on PH costs you nothing and means everything today: [link]*

### Hacker News

Title: **Show HN: MulmoClaude – Claude Code that produces docs, decks, spreadsheets, videos, and remembers everything**

Body (first comment): lead with the **AI-native OS thesis** and the Karpathy *LLM Knowledge Bases* reference. HN respects ideas over features — sell the idea, not the feature list. Explicitly state: *this runs the Claude Code CLI directly, not the API — that's why it can do what it does.*

### Reddit (r/ClaudeAI, r/LocalLLaMA, r/selfhosted)

- NOT a launch post. A build log: *"I spent 8 months giving Claude Code a shell. Here's the wiki-memory idea and what I learned."*
- PH link at the very bottom, one line.

### LinkedIn

**Skip on launch day.** LinkedIn is a phase-2 channel for the productivity audience. Chasing it on day one splits focus and signals "enterprise tool" to PH voters scanning categories. Queue a LinkedIn post for T+3 once the dev wave has landed.

### Japanese community (Note, X-JP)

Satoshi has a strong JP audience. Ship a Japanese version of the maker post and the hero video captions. Launch-day JP tweet at 09:00 JST = 17:00 PT the day before — catches the Asia-Pacific vote window.

---

## 9. Hunters & Community Seed List

- **Hunter target:** someone with 5k+ PH followers, ideally in the Claude/LLM space. If we can't land one, self-hunt — Satoshi's direct network is strong enough.
- **Seed voter list:** 50 people who've starred the repo or engaged with MulmoChat. DM them a calendar reminder Monday evening.
- **Commenter priming:** 4–6 people who will leave substantive (not cheerleading) comments in hours 1, 3, 6, 9. PH's algorithm weights comment velocity and diversity, not just upvotes.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                                   | Probability | Mitigation                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Activation gap — setup too heavy for PH day**        | **High**    | **Ship a hosted demo (see §10.5 below).** `npx create-mulmoclaude` alone isn't enough — 5-min install = 50% drop-off.                |
| Claude Code CLI auth fails on first run                | Medium      | Pre-flight check in the app; friendly error page linking to Claude Code docs                                                          |
| "It's just a wrapper" objection                        | Medium      | Lead with the anti-wrapper line verbatim: *"It runs Claude Code directly — not the API."* Reinforce with wiki + multi-session proof.  |
| Cognitive overload (too many features in one message)  | Medium      | Already addressed in §4 — 9 messages collapsed to 5, rest kept in reserve. Hold the line; don't let screenshots creep the list back. |
| Demo video latency from live Claude calls              | Medium      | Pre-record, splice, never show >3s of spinner                                                                                        |
| AGPL + Docker read as "hacker tool, not safe"          | Medium      | **Reframe:** sandbox = *"the level of care a real shell needs."* AGPL = *"open-source, local-first, no vendor lock-in."* Same facts, different framing. |
| Anthropic ships their own GUI the same week            | Low         | Frame as complementary — local-first, open-source, plugin-extensible                                                                 |

### 10.5 The activation problem — solve this or lose the day

This is the single biggest gap in the v1 plan. Reality check: even with `npx create-mulmoclaude`, the install path is **Node + Claude Code CLI auth + Gemini API key + Docker** — 5 to 10 minutes, developer-only, zero mobile. PH winners are instant gratification. We get upvotes mid-morning, then momentum dies by afternoon because nobody actually tried it.

**Three options, ranked by impact:**

**Option A (strongly recommended) — Hosted read-only demo at `demo.mulmoclaude.com`**
- Pre-loaded workspace with 10 prepared sessions: the research-paper → video flow, a Kyoto-trip doc, an ingested wiki with backlinks, a MulmoCast narrated presentation, a multi-session snapshot.
- Visitors can click through existing artifacts and replay the canvas — no typing required, no auth, no API key, no Docker.
- Budget: ~3 engineer-days. Ship it T-3. **This is the single highest-leverage change in the entire plan.**
- CTA in the hero video and every tweet becomes *"try it in your browser: demo.mulmoclaude.com"* instead of *"git clone"*.

**Option B (minimum viable) — "Watch Claude work" mode**
- A local mode that runs without a Gemini key or Claude auth, using pre-recorded session replays baked into the repo. `npx create-mulmoclaude --demo` drops the user into an interactive walkthrough in 30 seconds.
- Halves drop-off vs. a real install; doesn't match Option A but keeps the activation cost manageable.

**Option C (last resort) — Scripted screenshot walkthrough on the landing page**
- Click-through of the shock demo, parallel sessions, wiki backlinks, Telegram round-trip.
- No real interactivity but preserves the "I experienced it" feeling for PH skimmers.

**Decision:** commit to **Option A by T-7**. If scope slips, fall back to B before touching C.

## 11. Success Metrics

**Day of:**
- Product Hunt: **Top 5 of the day**; Top 10 is floor.
- GitHub stars: **+500** in 24h.
- **Hosted-demo sessions: 3,000 unique** (the real activation metric — §10.5).
- Installs (Gemini key inputs as proxy): **500** — secondary, since the demo absorbs the casual traffic.
- PH comments: **50+ substantive** (not counting our team).

**Week of:**
- Stars: **+1,500 cumulative.**
- HN: front page for >2 hours.
- Twitter: 2M+ impressions on launch thread.
- 3+ inbound podcast/interview requests.

**Month of:**
- 2,000 active weekly users (sessions logged).
- 5 community-contributed custom roles or plugins.
- One mention by @karpathy, @alexalbert, or an Anthropic engineer (aspirational but trackable).

## 12. The Two Bets

There are two things we have to land. Miss either and the launch is a 6 out of 10.

**Bet 1 — The shot (earns the upvote).**
The hero video's first 20 seconds: **a research paper dropped in, three Claude Code sessions producing a summary doc, a slide deck, and a narrated MulmoCast video in parallel.** That single frame is the pitch — concrete outputs + parallel sessions + MulmoCast, end of sentence. Nothing else on the market looks like it.

**Bet 2 — The hosted demo (earns the try).**
`demo.mulmoclaude.com` lets a PH skimmer click through the shock demo without installing anything. Without this, the upvote from Bet 1 doesn't convert into a GitHub star, a Twitter follow, or a build. Bet 1 gets you noticed; Bet 2 gets you remembered.

Everything else in this plan — bridges, sandbox, roles, wiki tour, skills launcher — is confirmation bias for a viewer who already believes. Cut anything that doesn't serve one of the two bets.

## 13. The Story Underneath (why we're doing this at all)

This is the first visible surface of a much bigger thesis: **computing is being re-platformed on top of AI agents, and the shell that platform needs doesn't exist yet.** Claude Code is the kernel. MulmoClaude is the first draft of the shell — and the shell's user-facing form is **a single folder that every input flows into and every output comes out of.**

`~/mulmoclaude/` is the home directory, reinvented for the AI era. In 1975 the home directory was where your files lived. In 2026 it's where your files, your research, your conversations, your scheduled work, and the knowledge extracted from all of them live — maintained by an AI that knows how to put things in the right place. That's the unlock. Not multi-modal output. Not parallel sessions. Not the bridges. Those are all *consequences* of having a single, local, AI-maintained convergence point. The differentiator is the **location**, not any feature on the list.

If the launch goes well, we're not celebrating a successful product launch — we're announcing the existence of a new computing surface. Phase 2 audiences (productivity users, knowledge workers, JP market, enterprise) come later, pulled in by the dev-native gravity we establish on day one.

That framing is what makes this plan aggressive rather than cautious. We're not trying to be a "very advanced tool." We're trying to show a glimpse of the future of computing, through one sharp product.

*Prepared for the MulmoClaude launch. Revise after the asset dry-run at T-7. Hosted-demo scope decision at T-10 — this is the critical path item.*
