// Regression guard for the bug fixed in commit 3b0613e: the fetcher
// modules self-register at import time, but nothing in the production
// boot chain imported them. `getFetcher(kind)` returned null for every
// source, the pipeline emitted 0 items, and no test failed because the
// existing pipeline tests inject a fake `getFetcher` via DI.
//
// This file imports `registerAll.ts` (the production bootstrap barrel)
// and asserts that the registry is populated for every FetcherKind the
// types module advertises. Adding a new FetcherKind without also
// registering it will now fail here.
